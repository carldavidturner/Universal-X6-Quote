		<p>The quote software has only been tested to be working 100% in Google Chrome. <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Get it here.</a></p>
	
		<h2>General Information</h2>
		
		<p>Fill in these boxes to add the quote number, company name, contact name and final price. Make sure you include any units for the price (e.g. £ or $)</p>
		
		<p>The information you put in these boxes will be used to create the file name and fill in the table on the front page of the quote, so it is crucial that these are accurate.</p>
		
		<h2>Machine Specification</h2>
		
		<p>The information that you fill in here will be entered into the quote. Please ensure that you have used the correct units (e.g. mm or µ).</p>
		
		<p>This information will also be sent to the engineering department for their specification sheets.</p>
		
		<h2>Quote Information</h2>
		
		<p>This is the information that will appear in the quote. Click on "Yes" for the information to be included, "No" for the information to be excluded and "Optional" for the information to be included in the Options section along with a price.</p>
		
		<h2>Creating a Quote</h2>
	
		<p>To create a quote, simply fill in all the information required and make the selections. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Get Quote".</p>
		
		<p>This will create the quote for you. Next, you need to save the output as a PDF. To do this, click on File > Print (or press Ctrl+P). This will bring up a box with settings in. You need to change the destination by clicking "Change" underneath where it says "Destination". You will need to click on "Save as PDF" from the options that appear. </p>
		
		<p>Click "Save" and then choose a location to save the file, much like any other file.</p>
