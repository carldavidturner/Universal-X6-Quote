		<h2>2. Universal X6 Slitter Rewinder</h2>		
	<br/>
		<p id="withimage">The Universal X6 slitting machine has been designed to produce perfect slit rolls time and time again. This versatile machine incorporates Universalâ€™s closed loop Total Tension Control System ensuring consistent and repeatable roll tension profiles. Using digital AC vector drives and integrated control system, the machine offers unprecedented control whilst being simple and friendly to operate. 
<br/><br/>Integrated technology allows remote diagnostics anywhere in the world simplifying ongoing support.

		<br/><h3>Key Benefits</h3>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Substantial construction</b><br/>The X6 utilises substantial, cross braced frames, precision bored as a pair. The rollers are aluminium tubes precisely machined and balanced. </p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Slit tension zone</b><br/>Unlike most competitive equipment, the X6 features an additional operator controllable tension zone. <br/>The tension through the slitting knives can be set independently of the unwind and rewind tensions, ensuring the optimum tension through the slitting knives.</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Precise rewind tension</b><br/>Closed loop tension control of the rewind utilising a pair of load cells for each rewind shaft as standard.</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Constant geometry layon rollers</b><br/>The X6 has linear (horizontal rather than pivoting) layon rollers. These do not vary their force as of the geometry change unlike conventional pivoting systems. </p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Simple operation</b><br/>Adjustable parameters have been minimised, so an operator can be trained in just a few hours. We believe the X6 is about as simple to operate as a duplex centre-wind slitter can be.</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Safety</b><br/>Universal ensures its machines conform to international safety standards including EN 13418:2008.</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>No hydraulics</b><br/>We do not use hydraulic systems for guiding or roll lift in, eliminating the risk of material contamination making the X6 ideal for slitting medical and food packaging products.</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Extensive recipe system</b><br/>Combined with the closed loop tension control system, our recipe system guarantees product repeatability.</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>Worldwide support</b><br/>Same day support is available by telephone, and additionally Internet support is available.  Service engineers are normally available within 48 hours.<br/>Additional support (drive system) can be obtained from Control Techniques LLC, a full list of worldwide service locations can be found at <a href="http://www.universalconvertingequipment.com/ct">www.universalconvertingequipment.com/ct</a>
</p>
		<p id="withoutimage"><b>UK Design and Build</b><br/>The X6 is designed and built in the UK.</p>
		<p id="withimage"><b>Minimised energy usage - ideas for efficient converting</b><br/>All of our machines are designed to use a minimal amount of energy and as a part of our sustainability program we have identified significant areas of energy wastage on winding machines.  We use the latest high efficiency AC motors combined with the most up to date AC Vector Drives.  A motor is used on the unwind rather than a brake - the motor generates electricity which is used to power the rewind motor rather than converting brake energy into heat.  The net result is an extremely energy efficient machine.</p>
